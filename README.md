# Overview

This is a drawing/painting app built in Android Studio using Kotlin.

I wanted to gain some more experience in building apps and creating a drawing app seemed like a good place to start.

# Development Environment

Like I mentioned above, this was built using the Android Studio IDE. 
The majority of the app was built using Kotlin, with some work being done in the necessary XML files. 
The following libraries were used:
- Android Graphics Library
- Android View Library
- Android Widget Library

# Future Work

- Additional Colors (better toolbar at the top, probably scrolling features)
- Change brush thickness
- Create a way to save drawings and edit them later
